    "A key principle of defensive programming is to \"fail fast\": as soon as something wrong is discovered, signal an error. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, the \"fail fast\" principle is implemented in 3 ways: <br><br>\n",
    "(1) Be strict about what you accept. <br>\n",
    "For example: if your function is not vectorized in its inputs, but uses functions that are, make sure to check inputs are scalars. <br>\n",
    "You can use `stopifnot()`, the `assertthat` package, or simple `if` statements and `stop()`. <br><br>\n",
    "(2) Avoid functions that use non-standard evaluation, like `subset, transform, with`. <br>\n",
    "They make assumptions to reduce typing. So when they fail, they often fail with uninformative error messages. <br><br>\n",
    "(3) Avoid functions that return different types of output depending on their input. <br><br>\n",
    "The 2 biggest offenders are `[` and `sapply()`. <br>\n",
    "(i) Whenever subsetting a data frame in a function, you should always use `drop = FALSE`, otherwise, you will accidentally convert 1-column data frames into vectors. <br><br>\n",
    "(ii) Never use `sapply()` inside a function: always use the stricter `vapply()` which will throw an error if the inputs are incorrect types and return the correct type of output even for zero-length inputs. "
